# Memorable-Places
The goal of the project was to make an app that saves the memorable places for the user, and later shows all the places with their addresses or time-stamps in a ListView and by clicking on each item in the ListView, Google Maps Activity opens that will display that particular place with a marker on it.
Two Activities are used in this Project, Main activity contains a ListView and the next Activity is Google Maps Activity. All the locations are saved in Android Studio's Shared Preferences Database, so the Memorable Places won't disappear once the app restarts.
Easy to use, efficient and gets the job done.
